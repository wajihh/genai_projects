            "Ask me a question (or type 'exit' to quit): what does quran say about jihad?\n",
            "Answer: The term \"Jihad\" in the Quran is often misunderstood. It is derived from the Arabic root \"Jahada\" which means to strive or struggle. In the Quran, Jihad is used in different contexts, primarily referring to the struggle in the path of God. It can be a personal struggle to maintain faith, to improve one's moral character, or to achieve righteous goals. \n",
            "\n",
            "In a broader social context, Jihad can refer to the struggle for social justice, to fight against oppression, or to spread the message of Islam. It can also refer to a physical struggle or warfare in self-defense or against aggression, but only under strict conditions and as a last resort. It's important to note that the Quran strongly emphasizes that any form of aggression or violence must be proportional, and non-combatants should not be harmed.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Quran also highlights the importance of peace, mercy, and forgiveness. For instance, in Quran 2:190, it says: \"Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors.\" This verse emphasizes the defensive nature of Jihad in Islam.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the interpretation and application of Jihad can vary among different Muslim communities and individuals, and it has been misused by some to justify acts of violence. It's crucial to understand that these acts are not representative of the teachings of the Quran or the beliefs of the majority of Muslims.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ask me a question (or type 'exit' to quit): what does it say about inheritance?\n",
            "Answer: The Quran has specific verses that detail the rules of inheritance. These are primarily found in Surah An-Nisa (The Women), verses 11, 12 and 176. \n",
            "\n",
            "In verse 4:11, it states that a son's share of the inheritance is to be twice that of a daughter's. It also provides guidance on how to distribute the inheritance if the deceased has children, parents, and a spouse.\n",
            "\n",
            "Verse 4:12 provides further instructions on inheritance distribution in the case of spouses and in situations where a man or woman leaves no direct heir (child or parent).\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, verse 4:176 clarifies the rules of inheritance when a man or woman dies without a direct heir or a brother or sister.\n",
            "\n",
            "The rules of inheritance in Islam are complex and specific, and they are designed to ensure a fair distribution of a person's wealth after their death. It is recommended to consult with a knowledgeable Islamic scholar or legal expert to fully understand and correctly apply these rules.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ask me a question (or type 'exit' to quit): what does it say about jews?\n",
            "Answer: The text provided does not specifically mention Jews or provide any commentary about them. It primarily discusses interpretations of Islamic texts and principles, as well as the responsibilities and moral conduct of Muslims.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ask me a question (or type 'exit' to quit): what attributes are required from a muslim?\n",
            "Answer: The text suggests several attributes that are required from a Muslim:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Consciousness of wrongdoings done in the name of God or Islam and the responsibility to speak out against them.\n",
            "2. Striving for the highest human perfection possible, known as the greater struggle (jih[d al-akbar), with the goal of moral healing.\n",
            "3. Giving up seeking justice for oneself while constantly struggling for justice for others.\n",
            "4. Not seeing oneself as superior to anyone else.\n",
            "5. Recognizing one's own vulnerabilities.\n",
            "6. Manifesting mercy, compassion, self-sacrifice, and forgiveness towards others.\n",
            "7. Following the example or Sunnah of the Prophet, which consists of his actions and sayings.\n",
            "8. Being open to understanding and accepting the Quran and Sunnah's view of men and women as complements of one another, not as superior-inferior.\n",
            "9. Engaging in the greater struggle of self-improvement, which is the beginning stage of the Sufi path.\n",
            "10. Respecting and understanding different sects within Islam, without necessarily representing any specific one.\n",
            "11. Upholding the central message of Islam: \"There is no god but God,\" Who alone is to be worshiped.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ask me a question (or type 'exit' to quit): what is mentioned in surah kahaf?\n",
            "Answer: Surah Al-Kahf, the 18th chapter of the Quran, contains several significant narratives and teachings. Here are some key points:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. The People of the Cave: This story is about a group of young believers who fled their disbelieving community and took refuge in a cave. They fell asleep and woke up thinking they had slept for a day or two, but in reality, they had slept for centuries. This story is a testament to God's power over time and life.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. The Man with Two Gardens: This parable tells the story of a wealthy man who was arrogant about his wealth and forgot to thank God for his blessings. He eventually lost everything, demonstrating the transient nature of worldly possessions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Moses and Khidr: This narrative recounts the journey of Prophet Moses and a wise man named Khidr. Khidr performs several actions that initially seem unjust or nonsensical, but he later explains the wisdom behind them. This story emphasizes the limitations of human knowledge and the importance of patience.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Dhul-Qarnayn: The final story is about a righteous king named Dhul-Qarnayn who traveled to the ends of the world, helping people and spreading justice. He built a massive wall to protect a community from the destructive tribe of Gog and Magog.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to these narratives, Surah Al-Kahf also emphasizes monotheism, the afterlife, and the importance of patience and gratitude. It is often recited on Fridays due to a tradition (Hadith) of the Prophet Muhammad that suggests reciting it on Fridays to gain a light that will shine from one Friday to the next.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ask me a question (or type 'exit' to quit): list all verses mentioning women\n",
            "Answer: As an AI, I don't have the ability to list all the verses mentioning women from the Quran as it would be a very extensive list. However, I can provide a few examples:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Surah An-Nisa (4:1): \"O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear Allah, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed Allah is ever, over you, an Observer.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Surah An-Nisa (4:19): \"O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:228): \"And due to the wives is similar to what is expected of them, according to what is reasonable. But the men have a degree over them [in responsibility and authority]. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Surah Al-Imran (3:195): \"And their Lord responded to them, 'Never will I allow to be lost the work of [any] worker among you, whether male or female; you are of one another. So those who emigrated or were evicted from their homes or were harmed in My cause or fought or were killed - I will surely remove from them their misdeeds, and I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as reward from Allah, and Allah has with Him the best reward.'\"\n",
            "\n",
            "These are just a few examples. The Quran mentions women in many other verses, discussing various aspects like their rights, responsibilities, and roles in society.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ask me a question (or type 'exit' to quit): what roles of women in society are mentioned?\n",
            "Answer: The text mentions several roles of women in society:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. As wives: The text discusses the interpretation of Quranic verses related to marriage, particularly those concerning the treatment of wives by their husbands. It also mentions the story of Job and his wife Rahmah, highlighting her role as a supportive and faithful wife.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. As scholars and interpreters: The author herself is a Muslim woman who has been schooled in Sufism and has lived in various Muslim communities. She has taken on the role of a scholar and interpreter of the Quran, challenging traditional interpretations and advocating for a more inclusive understanding.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. As victims of domestic violence: The text mentions women who end up in shelters for battered women, highlighting the issue of domestic violence within the context of Quranic interpretation.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. As advocates for change: The text mentions women who work in shelters for battered women and those who gathered at the WISE (Women’s Islamic Initiative in Spirituality and Equity) Conference to discuss the possibility of forming a Women’s Islamic Council. These women are portrayed as advocates for change within their communities.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. As spiritual beings: The author expresses a spiritual connection with all women, particularly those who have suffered from physical abuse. This highlights the role of women as spiritual beings within the Islamic faith.\n",
            "\n",
